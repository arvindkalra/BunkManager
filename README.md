# BunkManager

This a WebApplication that can be used by 
college going students as here they can manage their
attendance. In this app students can add their 
subjects and for each subject they can add their
number of lectures that took place and the number 
that they attended.

With this data the app tells you the number of safe 
bunks the student can make before he goes below
the 75% mark.

It is an interactive WebApplication whose 
client side is written using HTML, CSS, and JQuery.
For Server side we used NodeJS and MongoDB as the database.
